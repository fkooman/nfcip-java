Introduction
============
This project is a Java library to facilitate communication over NFCIP (Peer 2 
Peer) using ACS ACR122 NFC terminals. The library provides a reliable (i.e. 
resumes after connection tear) byte array communication channel between these 
NFC devices. This project provides a library for running on the Java SE 
environment.

The library was tested with:
 * two ACS ACR122 readers (firmware ACR122U102)

This library was tested on:
 * Windows Vista SP1, Sun's JDK 6 Update 13
 * Fedora 10 x86_64 with the included OpenJDK 
 * Ubuntu 9.04 x86_64 with the provided OpenJDK
 
Building
========
The easiest way to build this project is to use Ant, but also Eclipse can be 
used. We assume that you already have Java 6 installed (OpenJDK is fine).

  $ ant dist

Will generate a JAR file in the "dist" directory ready for use. You can also 
import the sources as an Eclipse project (the project files are included). 

Running
=======
Adding the NFCIP library to the classpath is enough to use it. Included are 
some simple tests that can be run from the command line (or from Eclipse):

  $ java -cp dist/nfcip-java-1.0.jar ds.nfcip.tests.NFCIPTestMain
  
or specify any other path to where the nfcip-java JAR is located.

See "--help" for more information on the parameters possible. One can use 
"--list-readers" to find the attached readers, and use "--initiator" or 
"--target" to specify the mode of operation. 

Suppose one has two ACR122 readers attached to one computer, one can be set 
to initiator and one to target and run the tests to send byte arrays between 
one another:

  $ java -cp dist/nfcip-java-1.0.jar \
       ds.nfcip.tests.NFCIPTestMain -i -d 0 -m 100 -M 1000

This will set the first device (-d 0) to initiator mode (-i) and start with 
sending 100 bytes, then expecting the same 100 bytes back from the target 
and then move on to 101 bytes, until 1000 is reached.

For the target one would use:

  $ java -cp dist/nfcip-java-1.0.jar \
       ds.nfcip.tests.NFCIPTestMain -t -d 1 -m 100 -M 1000

It is possible to enable various debugging levels to display an increasing 
amount of details on the transfer. Without specifying anything nothing is 
printed unless an error occurs. Use "--debug 1" to see progress information.
Increase the value to show more details up to including the raw APDUs being
sent to the ACR122.

Issues
======
There is an issue that when the protocol doesn't complete (user interrupted). 
The next time the program is started it will not be able to connect to the 
reader without unplugging the reader first. Maybe this can be solved by a 
Runtime.addShutdownHook in Java.
