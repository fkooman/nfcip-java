1.1.2   (20090605)
	- replace the "form" for printing progess information with TextField
	  which is updated once in a while, way more efficient, the form makes 
	  the MIDlet slow down A LOT.
	- actually expose the number of runs in the UI
	- keep track of the number of connection resets required
	- update the test to make the number of rounds be within the same
	  connection, so no new connection between rounds
    - print *DONE* on screen when test is done
    - replace the DataOutputStream with a PrintStream to make the files be
      readable by any text editor
    - move all classes into a package so we can use the classes as a library
    - add ant creation of just the library, for use in other projects 
    - print a dot to the phone screen every successful send/receive loop to
      make it easier to track progress when using two phones
    - append the UID (obtained with getUID()) to the log when connection is 
      established
    - persistent settings during MIDlet life time (mode, block size, etc.)
    
1.1.1   (20090420)
    - make block size configurable (add UI components)
    - merge NFCIPConnection from NFCIP library to add support for setBlockSize
    - update README to point to NFCIP library for platform requirements
	- added this CHANGELOG
