Introduction
============
This project is a Java ME library to facilitate communication over NFCIP (Peer 
2 Peer) using a Nokia NFC phone. The library provides a reliable (i.e. resumes 
after connection tear) byte array communication channel between NFC phones and 
or NFC reader devices. This project provides a library for running on the Java 
ME environment.

The library was tested with:
 * a ACS ACR122 reader (firmware ACR122U102)
 * Nokia 6131 NFC

The library will be tested with:
 * Two Nokia 6131 NFCs 
 * hopefully a Nokia 6212 Classic
  
Platform Requirements
=====================
See the README belonging to the NFCIP library project on how to get started
using different platforms.

Requirements
============
In case you want to build the MIDlet yourself you need some libraries. It is 
possible to build the MIDlet with only free software.

 * JDK 6
	Tested with OpenJDK 6
 * MicroEmulator (http://www.microemu.org/)
	Tested with version 2.0.3
 * ProGuard (http://proguard.sourceforge.net/)
	Tested with version 4.3
 * Ant JAD Task (http://nfcip-java.googlecode.com)
    Tested with version 1.0
 * JSR 257 Nokia Extension Stub Library (http://nfcip-java.googlecode.com)
 	Tested with version 1.0

This is all free software. Included in the "tools" directory is a 
"download-libs.sh" script for Unix that automatically downloads all the 
required libraries (except Java and Ant) and puts them in the correct place.

From the main source directory you can run:

  $ sh tools/download-libs.sh
  
This will take care of everything (requires wget). In case you want (or have 
to) download the libraries manually look in the "lib/lib.properties" file
where the individual JARs should be located (or modify this file to point to 
the correct location)

Building
========
The easiest way to build this project is to use Ant, but also Eclipse can be 
used. We assume that you already have Java 6 installed (OpenJDK is fine).

  $ ant deploy

This will generate a MIDlet Suite in the "deployed" directory containing of a 
preverified JAR file and the accompanying JAD file. 

Running
=======
This JAR (and optionally the JAD file) can be uploaded to the phone using for 
example Bluetooth. The MIDlet allows settings some parameters that can also 
be set using the command line in the NFCIP Java library. In case you enable 
debugging you need to be aware of the following:

  * there needs to be a memory card (default write location is on memory card)
  * you need to give permissions to access/write to the file system
      (this can be done by giving permission in "Application access -> Data 
       access -> Add and edit data")
