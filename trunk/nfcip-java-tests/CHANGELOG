1.3.0	(?)
	General:
	- make it work again with new API of nfcip-java
	- update MIDlet and TestApp to use "logging" instead of "debugging" as 
	  names for the new logging feature

1.2.0	(20090614)
	General:
	- put all external libraries in lib/lib.properties to put all version
	  configuration in this file
	- update the library download script to accomodate the new 
	  lib/lib.properties
	- cleanup the source layout of the build.xml file
	- make the number of resets actually work, not just stick at 1 always
	- now also send/receive the upper bound (maxDataLength) bytes
	- update for NFCIPTest API change
	- extensive update of README
	- update download script to download version 1.2.0 of the library
	
	App:
	- remove configurable block size from app
	- import the App from nfcip-java project
	
	MIDlet:
	- update version of JAD Ant Tasks to 1.1 (supports signing)
	- create a sign task to sign the MIDlet Suite
	- add sign.properties.default file to indicate what needs to be set
	- print the number of resets during the transfer on screen when test is 
	  complete	  
	- some Test MIDlet UI updates
	- remove all the test code from the MIDlet and use the general one
	  instead 
	- export the option to set fake initiator/fake target from MIDlet UI
	- set fake target as default
 	- update sign.properties.default to tell how to sign MIDlet Suite
	- remove configurable block size from UI
	- make the MIDlet not throw a NullPointerException when a non open 
	  connection is closed
	- stop the thread when a running test is cancelled so there will never 
	  be multiple threads 
	
1.1.2   (20090605)
	- replace the "form" for printing progess information with TextField
	  which is updated once in a while, way more efficient, the form makes 
	  the MIDlet slow down A LOT.
	- actually expose the number of runs in the UI
	- keep track of the number of connection resets required
	- update the test to make the number of rounds be within the same
	  connection, so no new connection between rounds
    - print *DONE* on screen when test is done
    - replace the DataOutputStream with a PrintStream to make the files be
      readable by any text editor
    - move all classes into a package so we can use the classes as a library
    - add ant creation of just the library, for use in other projects 
    - print a dot to the phone screen every successful send/receive loop to
      make it easier to track progress when using two phones
    - append the UID (obtained with getUID()) to the log when connection is 
      established
    - persistent settings during MIDlet life time (mode, block size, etc.)
    
1.1.1   (20090420)
    - make block size configurable (add UI components)
    - merge NFCIPConnection from NFCIP library to add support for setBlockSize
    - update README to point to NFCIP library for platform requirements
	- added this CHANGELOG
