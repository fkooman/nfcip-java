Testing the NFCIP-JAVA library
==============================
The tests use the nfcip-java library [1]. You need to download this library
and the test software (nfcip-java-tests). See the Java SE and Java ME section 
on how to run the tests.

Building the Tests
==================
These test classes use the nfcip-java library [1]. It is automatically 
downloaded by using the tools/download-libs.sh script as are all the 
libraries required for the MIDlet to be built:

	$ sh tools/download-libs.sh
	
After this you can compile the Java SE test application and the Java ME
test MIDlet:

	$ ant -f build-se.xml dist
	$ ant -f build-me.xml deploy
	
This will create the test JAR file in the "dist" directory and the test
MIDlet in the "deployed" directory.

Java SE
=======
To run the Java SE test application one runs:

	$ java -cp \ 
        /path/to/nfcip-java-se-VERSION.jar:\
        /path/to/nfcip-java-tests-se-VERSION.jar \
            ds.nfcip.tests.se.TestApp --help
		
This will list for more information on the parameters available. One can use 
"--list-readers" to find the attached readers, and use "--initiator" or 
"--target" to specify the mode of operation. 

Suppose one has two ACR122 readers attached to one computer, one can be set 
to initiator and one to target and run the tests to send byte arrays between 
one another:

    $ java -cp \ 
        /path/to/nfcip-java-se-VERSION.jar:\
        /path/to/nfcip-java-tests-se-VERSION.jar \
            ds.nfcip.tests.se.TestApp -i -d 0 -m 100 -M 1000

This will set the first device (-d 0) to initiator mode (-i) and start with 
sending 100 bytes, then expecting the same 100 bytes back from the target 
and then move on to 101 bytes, until 1000 is reached.

For the target one would use:

    $ java -cp \ 
        /path/to/nfcip-java-se-VERSION.jar:\
        /path/to/nfcip-java-tests-se-VERSION.jar \
            ds.nfcip.tests.se.TestApp -t -d 1 -m 100 -M 1000

It is possible to enable various log levels (--log) to display an increasing 
amount of details on the transfer. Without specifying anything (log level 0) 
only the progress and result of the tests are printed unless an error occurs. 
Increase the value to show more details up to including the raw APDUs being 
sent to the ACR122.

Java ME
=======
The MIDlet can be found in the "deployed" directory (when compiling it 
yourself) or as part of the nfcip-java-tests application. It can be installed 
on the phone using Bluetooth file transfer for example. Or by using a memory 
card. The MIDlet has a UI to configure settings that can also be configured by 
the command line tool. 

The MIDlet has the same extensive logging capabilities like the Java SE test
application. The path for the log file is hard coded and puts a file on the 
external memory card. The path can of course be changed by modifying the source 
code.

In order for logging to work the MIDlet Suite needs permission to write to the 
phone file system. This can be given by modifying the security parameters of 
the MIDlet Suite by changing "Application access" that can be found by going
to MIDlet Suite options in the application menu.

The phone can talk to a ACS ACR122, or to another phone. The radio in the 
Nokia 6131 NFC is weak, so when the phone is initiator (and thus generates the
radio field) the ACS ACR122 reader needs to be very close for communication to
succeed.
