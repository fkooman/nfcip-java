Reliability Testing
===================
Adding the NFCIP library to the classpath is enough to use it. Included are 
some simple tests that can be run from the command line (or from Eclipse):

  $ java -cp dist/nfcip-java-1.0.jar ds.nfcip.tests.NFCIPTestMain
  
or specify any other path to where the nfcip-java JAR is located.

See "--help" for more information on the parameters possible. One can use 
"--list-readers" to find the attached readers, and use "--initiator" or 
"--target" to specify the mode of operation. 

Suppose one has two ACR122 readers attached to one computer, one can be set 
to initiator and one to target and run the tests to send byte arrays between 
one another:

  $ java -cp dist/nfcip-java-1.0.jar \
       ds.nfcip.tests.NFCIPTestMain -i -d 0 -m 100 -M 1000

This will set the first device (-d 0) to initiator mode (-i) and start with 
sending 100 bytes, then expecting the same 100 bytes back from the target 
and then move on to 101 bytes, until 1000 is reached.

For the target one would use:

  $ java -cp dist/nfcip-java-1.0.jar \
       ds.nfcip.tests.NFCIPTestMain -t -d 1 -m 100 -M 1000

It is possible to enable various debugging levels to display an increasing 
amount of details on the transfer. Without specifying anything nothing is 
printed unless an error occurs. Use "--debug 1" to see progress information.
Increase the value to show more details up to including the raw APDUs being
sent to the ACR122.
